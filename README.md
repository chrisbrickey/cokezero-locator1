## FindCokeZero
iOS mobile app that provides locations of CokeZero retailers based on user input. Django REST framework enables browsable API and administrative management. Link to Google Maps API provides visual map of retailers carrying the multiple flavors of CokeZero.

### A very serious mission
I'm building this app because I love CherryCokeZero, but it's not omni-present. When I find myself in a new location, I have to scout out the stores that carry it. Surely, I'm not the only one! This app will keep track of those retailers and capture the knowledge of other CherryCokeZero consumers. This is an especially serious concern now that the Coca-Cola Company has announced the discontinuation of CokeZero.
